# Description
This "Simon Says" game implemented as a web project provides an engaging and interactive way for users to test and improve their memory skills. The game is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it features colorful buttons and responsive feedback mechanisms. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the game works and the code behind it:

# Functionality :

# Game Initialization
The game begins when the user presses any key on the keyboard. This triggers the keypress event listener that starts the game if it hasn't already started.

# Game Sequence and User Sequence
gameSeq is an array that stores the sequence of colors that the game generates.
userSeq is an array that stores the sequence of colors the user clicks.

# Level Progression
The levelUp function is called to increase the game level, update the display, and add a new color to the sequence. It chooses a random color from the predefined btns array, adds it to gameSeq, and flashes the corresponding button.

# User Interaction
Each button has an event listener for the click event, which triggers the btnPress function. This function records the user's choice, adds it to userSeq, and checks if the user's input matches the game sequence using the checkAns function.

# Sequence Matching
The checkAns function compares the user's input with the game sequence. If the user correctly matches the sequence, the game progresses to the next level. If the user makes a mistake, the game ends, and the screen displays a "Game Over" message along with the user's score.

# Visual Feedback
The gameFlash and userFlash functions provide visual feedback by temporarily changing the button colors when they are part of the game sequence or clicked by the user, respectively.

# Game Reset
The reset function reinitializes the game variables, allowing the user to start a new game.
